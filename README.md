# Tensor RNN
Source code for tensor recurrent neural network (RNN), improving vanilla RNN w.r.t

1. high-order Markov process

2. high-order interactions in hidden states

3. dimension reduction with tensor network model


## model
Baseline and tensor RNN models. Baselines include

1. seq\_rnn: vanilla RNN

2. seq\_lstm: LSTM

3. seq\_matrix: high-order RNN with first order interaction
